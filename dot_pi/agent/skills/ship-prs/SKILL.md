# Ship PRs

Take the topic the user gave and ship it as **slices**: the smallest PRs that each merge to `main` on their own. The work runs slice by slice, end to end — never as one big batch.

A **slice** is one PR that is independently shippable: it merges to `main` alone, without waiting for any later slice, and merging it never breaks prod. Prefer many small slices over one large PR — small is easier to review. Slices may **stack** (branch off the previous slice's branch instead of `main`) when one genuinely depends on another; a stacked slice is still scoped so its own merge is safe.

## 1. Grill the topic

Load and follow the `grilling` skill on the topic the user passed in. Resolve every design branch and dependency before moving on.

**Done when:** you and the user share a clear, complete understanding of what's being built.

## 2. Propose the slice plan

Break the work into the smallest set of slices. For each, the merge-safety test must hold: it ships to `main` alone and merging it can't break prod. Decide which slices stack and which are independent.

Present the plan to the user: the number of slices, each slice's scope in one line, and its branch base (`main` or the slice it stacks on). If the whole topic is already small and clear, propose a single slice and say so.

**Done when:** the user has signed off on the number of slices and their scope. Do not build before sign-off.

## 3. Ship each slice, one at a time

Loop over the approved slices **in order**. For each slice, run the full cycle before touching the next one:

1. **Isolate.** Load and follow `using-git-worktrees` to create a dedicated worktree so parallel agents never collide. Branch off `main` for an independent slice, off the previous slice's branch for a stacked one.
2. **Build.** Load and follow `subagent-driven-development`, treating this slice's scope as its plan — fresh implementer subagent per task, TDD, task review, and the final whole-branch review. (This `create-pr` step replaces SDD's finishing-a-development-branch.)
3. **Open the PR.** Load and follow `create-pr` to open the slice's pull request **as a draft** (`gh pr create --draft`). Leave it for the user to mark ready for review.
4. **Record** the slice's PR title, link, and one-line summary, then move to the next slice.

**Done when:** every approved slice has an open PR.

**Never batch.** Building every slice and only then opening the PRs is the exact failure this skill exists to prevent. A slice is not finished until its PR is open; the next slice's build does not start before that.

## 4. Report

For every PR opened, output one block:

- **Title** — the PR title
- **Link** — the PR URL
- **What it does** — one line
